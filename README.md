# go-RESTful-MVC

Build yout clean RESTful application with MVC design pattern for reused code and the fastest web framework for Golang, [go-siris framework](https://github.com/go-siris/siris)!.

Built using Go language with go-siris framework (The fastest web framework for Golang | fasthttp) and dynamodb as an example of database configuration. Please support [go-siris framework](https://github.com/go-siris/siris) (The fastest web framework for Golang!) and read more about it to properly use and develop this project, as [go-siris](https://github.com/go-siris/siris) was the core of this project.

If you're coming from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) world, this is the [expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs/express)++ equivalent for the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org). And if you're also familiar with the masterpiece [Java Spring Framework](https://spring.io), this project were applying MVC design pattern from [Spring MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html) to build a solid RESTful web application using the nearly popular new language of Go.
